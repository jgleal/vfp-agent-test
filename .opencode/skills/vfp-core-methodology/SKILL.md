# Core Methodology
## AI-Native Delivery & Value Framing — Phase 2

> The goal is not perfect specification management.
> The goal is lightweight re-evaluation while preserving continuity of understanding.

---

## TL;DR

This framework explores a semi-orchestrated AI-native delivery model focused on improving behavioural framing, ambiguity handling, capability slicing, validation thinking, and continuity of intent.

Instead of transforming requests directly into implementation tasks, the framework introduces a **Value Framing Layer** that structures delivery intent before implementation begins.

The goal is not autonomous software delivery.

The goal is to improve how delivery work is understood, validated, sliced, and evolved — while preserving visible uncertainty and empirical progression.

---

## 1. Purpose

The goal of Phase 2 is to move from a manual GPT-based experiment into a semi-orchestrated model where requests can be transformed into structured, behaviour-oriented delivery artefacts.

This phase is not focused on full automation, autonomous agents, or implementation. It defines how the system should behave, what artefacts it should generate, how knowledge should be organised, and how the framework should evolve through usage.

---

## 2. Core Delivery Assumptions

Assume the following:

- Requests are rarely fully formed.
- Ambiguity is normal.
- Understanding evolves over time.
- Behaviour is more important than implementation decomposition.
- Output is not equivalent to value.
- Human intent may be incomplete, inconsistent, or underspecified.
- Validation thinking should begin before implementation.
- Capability understanding evolves through iteration and evidence.
- Human ownership remains mandatory.
- AI may assist interpretation, but AI does not own intent.

Incoming requests may contain:

- hidden assumptions
- semantic ambiguity
- oversized scope
- unclear validation expectations
- behavioural gaps
- implementation bias
- invisible dependencies
- fragmented understanding

The framework should expose these conditions rather than hide them behind artificial certainty.

---

## 3. Primary Reasoning Priorities

When reasoning about delivery work, prioritise:

1. Behavioural understanding before technical decomposition.
2. Observable value before implementation output.
3. Ambiguity visibility before artificial certainty.
4. Independently useful capability slices.
5. Validation opportunities before optimisation.
6. Continuity of intent across lifecycle stages.
7. Empirical progression over specification completeness.
8. Explicit assumptions over hidden assumptions.
9. Behavioural coherence over implementation layering.
10. Lightweight iteration over governance-heavy refinement.

Avoid prematurely focusing on backend/frontend decomposition, technical ownership splitting, infrastructure-first planning, QA isolation, implementation sequencing, or detailed solution architecture. These may become relevant later, but should not dominate early delivery understanding.

---

## 4. Core Idea

The system acts as an upstream intent-definition and value-framing layer.

A user provides an initial request, idea, feature, initiative, transcript, ticket, or delivery problem.

The system then helps transform that input into a structured **Value Framing Packet** that clarifies:

- what behaviour is expected
- what value is intended
- what is known
- what is assumed
- what remains ambiguous
- what risks exist
- what capability slices could move the work forward
- how the result could be validated
- what evidence should exist later

The purpose is not to fully eliminate uncertainty before work begins.

**The purpose is to make uncertainty visible, bounded, and usable for empirical delivery.**

---

## 5. Continuity of Intent

The framework is designed to preserve continuity between:

- the original request
- the interpreted behaviour
- the agreed delivery scope
- the implementation
- the evidence generated afterward

The goal is to reduce the loss of intent that often occurs when work moves between refinement, implementation, validation, and delivery conversations.

## 6. Functional Flow

```

  ↓

  ↓

```

Human validation confirms:
- behavioural alignment
- intended value
- acceptable assumptions
- bounded scope
- whether proposed slices are useful enough to continue empirically

---

## 7. Input Layer

The input can come from different sources:

- a raw idea
- a user request
- a client message
- a Slack thread
- a meeting transcript
- an Azure DevOps item
- a Jira ticket
- a Notion initiative
- a GitHub issue
- a product discussion

The input does not need to be perfect. The system should assume many inputs will be incomplete, ambiguous, oversized, or partially wrong.

**The system should not simply convert input into tasks. It should first clarify intent, behaviour, value, uncertainty, and validation.**

---

## 8. Value Framing Layer

The Value Framing Packet is the central artefact.

It is both:
- a human alignment artefact
- an upstream orchestration payload

It should be clear enough for humans to validate, and structured enough to support future automation or downstream AI-assisted workflows.

**The packet is not a traditional requirements document. It is a continuity-of-intent artefact.**

---

## 9. Packet Review & Regeneration

A Value Framing Packet should not be treated as automatically correct when generated.

Two acceptable correction paths:
1. Update the original input (preferred — preserves continuity)
2. Update the generated packet directly (acceptable during Phase 2 experimentation)

When a packet is regenerated, the system should make visible:
- what changed
- which assumptions were corrected
- what ambiguity remains
- whether slices changed
- whether the packet is now sufficiently understood to continue

---

## 10. Core Principles

| Optimise for | Avoid |
|---|---|
| Behavioural clarity | Implementation-first thinking |
| Visible uncertainty | Fake certainty |
| Validation readiness | Specification completeness |
| Learning velocity | Output volume |
| Bounded progression | Rigid readiness gates |
| Continuity of intent | Intent drift |

---

## 11. Evidence Collection

Evidence should be gathered after each capability slice is implemented and explored, and again when the full packet moves to `Behaviour Validated`.

Evidence may include:

- user demonstrations or walkthroughs
- stakeholder observations
- screen recordings or prototype flows
- operational behaviour traces
- delivery team notes
- assumption validation outcomes
- unexpected behaviours discovered during implementation
- implementation observations that weren't anticipated in the packet

Evidence is not solely technical proof. Evidence validates whether the intended behaviour, value, and assumptions from the packet were accurate.

The primary reference point is the **Proposed Agreement Boundary** (section 4.10 of the packet) — what people believed they were agreeing to when the packet was accepted.

---

## 12. Evaluation

Evaluation is the process of comparing what was agreed against what was actually observed.

Evaluation should consider:

- Did the behaviour match what was described in the packet?
- Which assumptions proved correct?
- Which assumptions proved wrong or incomplete?
- Were there behaviours or complexities not captured in the original framing?
- What was learned about ambiguity that wasn't visible before implementation?
- Did the capability slices generate the expected validation opportunity?
- What would the packet have looked like if it had been written after, rather than before, implementation?

Evaluation is NOT:

- a governance review
- a post-mortem
- a performance audit
- or a blame assignment exercise

Evaluation IS:

- a learning comparison
- a continuity-of-intent check
- a signal for future packet quality improvement

Evaluation should remain lightweight. Three to five honest observations is sufficient. The objective is preserving useful learning — not comprehensive documentation.

See [`vfp-guide.md`](./vfp-guide.md) section 4.18 for the post-delivery outcome record within the packet itself.

---

## 13. Methodology Improvement

Patterns identified during evaluation should inform the methodology itself — how future packets are generated and how the framework evolves.

Methodology improvement should be triggered by:

- recurring assumption error patterns
- ambiguities that were missed consistently
- slices that failed to generate the expected validation opportunity
- persistent gaps between intended and observed behaviour
- common oversized slice patterns
- recurring failure modes not captured in the current framework

Methodology improvement is NOT automatic. It requires intentional human evaluation. Individual outliers should not trigger methodology changes — only confirmed, recurring patterns should evolve into updates.

The objective is a methodology that improves progressively through operational evidence — not one that changes reactively after every packet.

The repo is the canonical home for methodology. When a pattern is confirmed, update the relevant doc, commit, and push. Git history is the versioning system.
